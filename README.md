# Unsupervised-Learning-for-Clustering-of-customer-segments

**Introduction** This Project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

In this, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that has been provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

## Files
